struct "point" is used to keep track of the x, y position and the height at that point.

the main method calls stat1()

stat1() takes in standard input witch is expected to be a set of 3 doubles, the first two are the x and y values of the center of a grid square, the third value is the height of that square.
stat1() then takes the first value and sets it as the high point and low point, then it reads all the other points,
if it finds a point higher then the current high point that new point becomes the new high point. the same thing happens with the low point if the new point is lower.
